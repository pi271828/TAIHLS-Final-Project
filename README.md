# TAIHLS-Final-Project

Project Overview:

The leading cause of death in patients that have cancer is often the spread of cancer to other parts of the body, also known as cancer metastasis. The main force driving cancer metastasis lies in the Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), where cells transition from the epithelial state (stationary and structured) to the mesenchymal state (loosely organized, very mobile, and invasive).
